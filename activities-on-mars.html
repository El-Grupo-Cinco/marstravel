        <h2>Do things you couldn't do back home!</h2>
        <p>Imagine 4 meters leaps as you jump, slowly falling back to the surface, racing electric racer rovers across the red plains or even climbing the highest mountain accessible to man.
          Afterwards you could relax in town playing a game of 3D chess enjoying a beer. <br/><br/>
          At Mars Travel we are sure to have an activity that suits you.</p>

        <h2>The jumping track</h2>
        <h3>JUMP AROUND!</h3>
        <p>At one fourth of Earth’s gravity, you are going to go far!
          Jump four to six meters in the air or throw a 20 kg lead ball 20m away, test your new super powers!<br/>
          Next to the city, train on our track field with our experienced coaches.
          Why not finishing the day in town at our sport club’s sauna. <br/><br/>
          We warmly recommend pole vaulting since you could easily beat the Earth record. <br/><br/>
          Come back to Earth a gold medalist!</p>

        <h2>Rover racing</h2>
        <h3>3, 2, 1 RACE!</h3>
        <p>Are you feeling the need... the need for speed? <br/>
          Come try your skills at the race rover track: an 10 km (6 miles) off-road path next to town. <br/>
          Our electrical rovers can manage speeds in the 100 KPH (62 MPH) in a straight line. <br/>
          The track offers jumps and sharp turns. <br/><br/>
          With Olympus Mons in the background, the scenery is fantastic! <br/>
          So buckle up and race through the red dust in our state-of-the-art rover. 
          Safety is guaranteed thanks to all-embracing airbag, the same technology used on the old probes landing on Mars in the 2000s. <br/><br/>
          Sunday is Grand Prix day, during which you can compete and win a free dinner at one of our luxurious restaurants. <br/> Alternatively, you can watch the race back in the city. </p>

        <h2>Mountain climbing</h2>
        <h3>Be the tallest in the solar system!</h3>
        <p>Earthlings are pretty proud of Mount Everest with an elevation barely reaching 8,9 km (27,657 ft). <br/>
          Here on Mars the Olympus Mons is a staggering 21.9km (72,000 ft) high volcano, the tallest in the solar system!<br/>
          Come on our one week climb and conquer this magnificent mountain and become a true space mountaineer.<br/>
          You’ll be spending the nights in luxurious cabins installed along the way.
          The space-suits are specifically adapted for this endeavour with a water sytem, the latest in safety technology and more.<br/><br/>
          <b>Breath taking views all the way</b><br/>
          Mars scenery is amazing. Along your climb you’ll witness the jaw-dropping landscape of Mars. You’ll see blood red sunsets and early birds will catch the most beautiful sunrise in the solar system.<br/><br/>
          <b>Expert leaders</b><br/>
          Your party will be lead by expert mountaineers. They know the all the paths to the summit and they are trained in modern xenoplanet wilderness survival techniques. You can’t go wrong with these gals and guys!<br/><br/>
          <b>A memory for life</b><br/>
          It might seem odd to be spend so much time on one single activity but take our word for it: it’s worth it. <br/>
          Remember the great philosophers of AC/DC:<br/></p>
