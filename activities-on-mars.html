        <h2>Do things you couldn't do back home!</h2>
        <p>Imagine 4 meters leaps as you jump, slowly falling back to the surface, racing electric racer rovers across the red plains or even climbing the highest mountain accessible to man.
          Afterwards you could relax in town playing a game of 3D chess enjoying a beer. <br/><br/>
          At Mars Travel we are sure to have an activity that suits you.</p>

        <h2>The jumping track</h2>
        <h3>JUMP AROUND!</h3>
        <p>At one fourth of Earth’s gravity, you are going to go far! <br/>
          Jump four to six meters in the air or throw a 20 kg lead ball 20m away, test your new super powers!<br/>
          Next to the city, train on our track field with our experienced coaches.
          Why not finishing the day in town at our sport club’s sauna. <br/><br/>
          We warmly recommend pole vaulting since you could easily beat the Earth record. <br/><br/>
          Come back to Earth a gold medalist!</p>

        <h2>Rover racing</h2>
        <h3>3, 2, 1 RACE!</h3>
        <p>Are you feeling the need... the need for speed? <br/>
          Come try your skills at the race rover track: an 10 km (6 miles) off-road path next to town. <br/>
          Our electrical rovers can manage speeds in the 100 KPH (62 MPH) in a straight line. <br/>
          The track offers jumps and sharp turns. <br/><br/>
          With Olympus Mons in the background, the scenery is fantastic! <br/>
          So buckle up and race through the red dust in our state-of-the-art rover. 
          Safety is guaranteed thanks to all-embracing airbag, the same technology used on the old probes landing on Mars in the 2000s. <br/><br/>
          Sunday is Grand Prix day, during which you can compete and win a free dinner at one of our luxurious restaurants. <br/> Alternatively, you can watch the race back in the city. </p>

        <h2>Mountain climbing</h2>
        <h3>Be the tallest in the solar system!</h3>
        <p>Earthlings are pretty proud of Mount Everest with an elevation barely reaching 8,9 km (27,657 ft). <br/>
          Here on Mars the Olympus Mons is a staggering 21.9km (72,000 ft) high volcano, the tallest in the solar system!<br/>
          Come on our one week climb and conquer this magnificent mountain and become a true space mountaineer.<br/>
          You’ll be spending the nights in luxurious cabins installed along the way.
          The space-suits are specifically adapted for this endeavour with a water sytem, the latest in safety technology and more.<br/><br/>
          <b>Breath taking views all the way</b><br/>
          Mars scenery is amazing. Along your climb you’ll witness the jaw-dropping landscape of Mars. You’ll see blood red sunsets and early birds will catch the most beautiful sunrise in the solar system.<br/><br/>
          <b>Expert leaders</b><br/>
          Your party will be lead by expert mountaineers. They know the all the paths to the summit and they are trained in modern xenoplanet wilderness survival techniques. <br/>
          You can’t go wrong with these gals and guys!<br/><br/>
          <b>A memory for life</b><br/>
          It might seem odd to be spend so much time on one single activity but take our word for it: it’s worth it! <br/>
          Remember the great philosophers of AC/DC:<br/></p>

            <h2>Sight-seeing</h2>
            <h3>See the sight!</h3>
              <p>If you want to enjoy a lid-back activity but still want to experience the Martian landscape, you can opt for a sight-seeing tour.<br/>
              Embark on our automatized rover “Uzoma III” and discover the great outdoors. The tour will take you to some historical sites like the Ingenuity rover resting place or even the crash site of Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster (launched from Earth in 2018 as a joke). <br/>
              So let the recorded voice of Morgan Freeman guide you among the plains surrounding the city, telling you amazing facts about the Red Ball.</p>

        <h2>The walk-about</h2>
        <h3>The true martian experience</h3>
        <p>One of the the best way to experience Mars is the walk-about. <br/>
          You can choose either the our one-hour or three hours tour and really become one with the planet. <br/>
          The low gravity makes it pleasant and easy to hike around the landscape. <br/> <br/>
          Discover the topography of Mars, visit the alien cave or the even terraforming plant. <br/>
          Normally a navigation system guides you but for a minor fee a human guide will provide you with information and exciting facts not commonly known. <br/> <br/>
          The space-suits are specifically adapted for this endeavour with a water sytem, satelite navigation, the latest in safety technology and more.</p>

            <h3>Take it easy back in town</h3>
            <p>If you want to take it easy for a while, why not enjoy our in-dome activities?
              Play a game of giant 3D chess on Angus Avenue, relax in the spa, try our bars and restaurants, dance in low-G at the David Guetta Space Rave Club or just watch the sun sets through the panoramic windows of The End Of The World pub.
              What ever you are in to: we got you covered!
              Ask for more information (at the reception or dial 666 at  a terminal) upon your arrival.</p>
